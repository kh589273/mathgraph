Math Graph Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Math Graph app for Android!

As an Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data generated when using the app is stored on your device only, and is immediately erased when you close the app.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will work towards removing that vulnerability.

Yours sincerely,

Harun Kimani.
